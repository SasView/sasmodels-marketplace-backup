# Enhanced Cylinder Models for SasView

These models are designed to handle the integration of the highly oscillatory functions more effectively. By dynamically adjusting the number of Gauss–Legendre quadrature points based on the specific parameters of each function, these models ensure more precise and reliable results. This approach significantly improves integration accuracy compared to standard methods, particularly in challenging scenarios where a quadrature with a fixed number of points might fail or be too inefficient. These optimized models are ready for use in SasView, providing enhanced performance without altering the original model functionalities. Available Enhanced Cylinder Models - Core-Shell Bicelle - Core-Shell Cylinder - Cylinder - Flexible Cylinder with Elliptical Cross-section - Hollow Cylinder Installation - Navigate to the models folder in the sasmodels package. This should be located in your Sasview installation. - Copy the files ending in `*_high_res.c` and `*_high_res.py` here. You don't need to install all of them, just the `.py` and `.c` files of the model you require. - Copy the `kron.c`, `lookup_cos.c`, `lookup_sin.c` to the `lib` folder located in the models folder. These files exceed the maximum size of flies that can be uploaded so you can find them [here](https://github.com/davidnwobi/Integral-Fitting-Tool/tree/master/models/lib) - In the same directory as the `lib` folder, create a folder named `integration` and place the `*_integration.c` file of the model you require there. TL;DR `*_high_res.c` and `*_high_res.py` -> sasmodels/models directory `kron.c`, `lookup_cos.c`, `lookup_sin.c` ->  sasmodels/models/lib directory `*_integration.c` ->  sasmodels/models/integration directory (create if it does not exist)
