Lorentz (Ornstein-Zernicke Model)

Definition

The Ornstein-Zernicke model is defined by

$$ I(q)=\frac{\text{scale}}{1+(qL)^2}+\text{background} $$ The parameter $L$ is the screening length *cor_length*.

For 2D data the scattering intensity is calculated in the same way as 1D, where the $q$ vector is defined as

$$ q=\sqrt{q_x^2 + q_y^2} $$
