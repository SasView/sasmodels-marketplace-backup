# Superparamagnetic Core-Shell Spheres

This model describes the SANS of individual (dilute), superparamagnetic particles for which the alignment of the particle moments along the magnetic field is disturbed by thermal fluctuations. The magnetic field is assumed horizontal and perpendicular to the incoming neutron beam. For a more general 3D orientation of the magnetic field, we refer to the version "Superparamagnetic Core-Shell Spheres with 3D field orientation".
