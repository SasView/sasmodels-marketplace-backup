# Peak Lorentz

This model describes a Lorentzian shaped peak on a flat background. Definition The scattering intensity $I(q)$ is calculated as $$  I(q) = \frac{scale}{\bigl(1+\bigl(\frac{q-q_0}{B}\bigr)^2\bigr)} + background $$ with the peak having height of $I_0$ centered at $q_0$ and having a HWHM (half-width half-maximum) of B. For 2D data the scattering intensity is calculated in the same way as 1D, where the $q$ vector is defined as $$  q = \sqrt{q_x^2 + q_y^2} $$ References None.

$$  I(q) = \frac{scale}{\bigl(1+\bigl(\frac{q-q_0}{B}\bigr)^2\bigr)} + background $$ with the peak having height of $I_0$ centered at $q_0$ and having a HWHM (half-width half-maximum) of B.

For 2D data the scattering intensity is calculated in the same way as 1D, where the $q$ vector is defined as

$$  q = \sqrt{q_x^2 + q_y^2} $$
