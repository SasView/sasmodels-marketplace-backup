# core_multi_shell_cylinder

Core multi-shell cylinders or discs, may be used for multi-walled tubes or a stack of discs. This model will eventually be added to a Sasview release, there are still some (rather technical) issues as noted in the python code.  Meanwhile though this is a work in progress, it should give good results, and has been road tested by several different users. There are many parameters to the model, you may need to use constraints to limit the number being fit, and even then some common sense plus trial & error adjustments. NOTE previous test versions were call core_multishell_cylinder, this new version is core_multi_shell_cylinder to conform with the naming of other Sasview models.
