# Field-dependent magnetic SANS of misaligned magnetic moments in bulk ferromagnets

For bulk ferromagnets, this model allows to analyze the field-dependent purely magnetic SANS. The misalignment scattering is obtained by subtracting the reference scattering at a high (saturating) magnetic field from the scattering at lower applied fields. The scattering signal results from nanoscale deviation of the magnetization from the field direction in the approach to magnetic saturation (single domain state). Typical materials that are analyzed in such a way are cold-worked elemental magnets, hard and soft magnetic nanocomposites, amorphous alloys and precipitates in magnetic steel. The magnetic SANS depends on the magnetic interactions, the magnetic microstructure (defect/particle size, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, saturation magnetisation) and on the applied magnetic field.
