# Gaussian Peak

Definition This model describes a Gaussian shaped peak on a flat background $$  I(q) = (\text{scale}) \exp\left[ -\tfrac12 (q-q_0)^2 / \sigma^2 \right] + \text{background} $$ with the peak having height of *scale* centered at $q_0$ and having a standard deviation of $\sigma$. The FWHM (full-width half-maximum) is $2.354 \sigma$. For 2D data, scattering intensity is calculated in the same way as 1D, where the $q$ vector is defined as $$  q = \sqrt{q_x^2 + q_y^2} $$ References None.
