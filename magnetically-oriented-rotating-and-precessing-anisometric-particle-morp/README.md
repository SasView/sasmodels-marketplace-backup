# Magnetically oriented, rotating and precessing anisometric particle (MORP)

The model will describe the magnetic response of anisometric iron oxide (haematite) nanoparticles based the paper [D. Zakutna et al., Nanoscale 11, 7149 (2019)]. Hematite nanospindles are magnetized perpendicular to their long axis and thus align with their short axis along the external field leading to a very peculiar orientation of the long particle axis perpendicular to the magnetic field. The calculation involves three orientational distributions, which makes it a testbed to measure performance.
