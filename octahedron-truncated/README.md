# Octahedron_truncated

This model provides the form factor, $P(q)$, for a general octahedron. It can be a regular octahedron shape with all edges of the same length. Or a general shape with different elongations along the three perpendicular two-fold axes. It includes the possibility to add an adjustable square truncation at all the six vertices. This model includes the general cuboctahedron shape for the maximum value of truncation. The form factor expression is obtained by analytical integration over the volume of the shape. [1] This model is constructed in a similar way as the rectangular_prism model. It contains both the form factor for a fixed orientation and the 1D form factor after orientation average.
