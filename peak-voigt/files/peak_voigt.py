This model describes a pseudo-Voigt shaped peak on a flat background.

Definition
----------

This pseudo-Voigt peak function is a weighted linear summation of
Lorentzian (L) and Gaussian (G) peak shapes. The usefulness of this
function is that it produces a peak shape with asymmetry.
 
The scattering intensity $I(q)$ is calculated as

.. math::

    I(q) = scale . [{W_f.I(q)_L} + {(1-W_f).I(q)_G}] + background
	
where $W_f$ is a weighting factor and

.. math::

    I(q)_L = frac{1}{igl(1+igl(frac{q-q_0}{HWHM}igr)^2igr)}


    I(q)_G = expleft[ -frac12 (q-q_0)^2 / sigma^2 ight]

The peak is taken to be centered at $q_0$ with a HWHM (half-width
half-maximum) of 1.177 $sigma$, where $sigma$ is the standard deviation
of the Gaussian. In other words, the widths of the Lorentzian and the
Gaussian have been coupled for convenience of parameterisation.

When $W_f$ = 1 a Lorentzian peak is returned, and when $W_f$ = 0 a
Gaussian peak is returned.

For practical purposes 0 < $sigma$ < 0.1 else no peak is generated.

For 2D data the scattering intensity is calculated in the same way as 1D,
where the $q$ vector is defined as

.. math::

    q = sqrt{q_x^2 + q_y^2}
