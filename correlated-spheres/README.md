# correlated_spheres

Definition ---------- The 1D scattering intensity of two correlated spherical particles can be written as: $P(q)=F_1^2 + F_2^2 + 2*F_1*F_2 * sin(qD)/qD$, where $F_1$ and $F_2$ are the scattering amplitudes of particle1 and particle2 respectively, D is the center-to-center distance between the two particles. Particularly, this model is to calculate the scattering intensity of two spatially correlated hard spheres of different size(radius) and scattering length density(SLDs) at fixed distance D from each other.
