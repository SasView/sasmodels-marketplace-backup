# lamellar_Slab_APL_nW

This model provides the scattering intensity, $I(q)$, for a lyotropic lamellar phase where a random distribution in solution are assumed. The SLD of the outer, solvent-exposed region is taken to be different from the SLD of the inner region. This model is intended to be used with input parameters including the molecular volumes and  bound coherent scattering length of the inner portion of the amphiphile (solvent not exposed), the outer portion of the amphiphile (outer solvent exposed), and solvent molecule. The variable parameters are intended to be the APL, the average area per amphiphile (lipid) molecules at the inner/outer interface and n_W, the number of solvent (water) molecules residing in the outer region of the bilayer. This model is adapted from the lipid bilayer model of Nagle and Wiener(1988) and fitting function lamellar_hg. Note that the model can be applied with other combinations of input parameters/assumptions; and is ideally applied as a simultaneous fit to datasets with multiple independent measurements; such as neutron contrast variation strategies.
